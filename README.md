# Seismic2Velocity_Submission_Pipeline
This repository houses the submission pipeline developed for the Yale/UNC-CH - Geophysical Waveform Inversion Kaggle competition. The project focuses on leveraging physics-guided machine learning models to address full-waveform inversion (FWI) problems, specifically in the context of subsurface compaction.
